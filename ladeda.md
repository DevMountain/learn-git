hello there, how's it going?
sidenotes: good practice would be to get in the habit of *not* using spaces in directory names.
some basic aliases could be helpful (especially with git).
github's 'hub' client is also pretty fantastic (as are cligh (pip install cligh) and gh (npm i -g gh); they add github functionality (and a wee bit of friendliness) to traditional git.
