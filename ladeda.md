Hello! How's it going?

Notes: It may be worth mentioning the usefulness of aliases (briefly, especially for git) and/or the various front-ends (cligh through pip, gh through npm, hub directly from github)--they make some things a little friendlier and add Github-specific functionality.

Also might be worth a mention: it'd be a good practice to get into *not* using spaces in directory/file names; no one likes seeing `protocol://domain.tld/%20` or escaping.

Oh, also setting up SSH keys would be a valuable quick lesson--though obvs given time constraints it's not the most important thing.
