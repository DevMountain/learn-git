Write a program that exports a string containing a sound a robot would be likely
to make. Here's some boilerplate code you can use to get started:

  module.exports = 'your sound goes here...'

Save that code into a file, YOUR_PROGRAM.js (you can name it whatever you like)
and then:

  Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify YOUR_PROGRAM.js` to verify your program.
  Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND run YOUR_PROGRAM.js` to run your program.
