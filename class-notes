Fork A Repo
-------------
1. Fork the repo in github so that you have a version of the repo in your git hub and so that you can push it to the origin (to the repo)

2. git clone the repo so that you have a version of the repo locally

3. Now you will be able to push changes to the repo

4. Make a pull request from your version of the repo to the origal repo from where you forked.

Rebase
-------
This will pull master but keep your changes and rebase to a new peek.
